# Crisis and Opportunity

![](img/jfk.jpg){width=80%}

# Crisis and Opportunity

The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One
brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a
crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.

-- John F. Kennedy

# Top Three List

1. Learn a programming language (statistical, command)

<!-- Speaking directly through the computer, not a mouse interpreter -->
<!-- Learning at least one language gives you access to many -->

# Top Three List

1. Learn a programming language (statistical, command)
2. Make your workflow transparent (data, code and notes)

<!-- Programming languages help, formal syntax and grammar -->
<!-- Minimize manual data processing -->
<!-- Clear path to data -->
<!-- Embedding notes and code and link to results (Rmarkdown) -->

# Top Three List

1. Learn a programming language (statistical, command)
2. Make your pipelines transparent (data, code and notes)
3. Share and take credit! 

<!-- Programming has produced many tools to track, attribute and share -->
<!-- Can automate many parts of workflows from data porcessing to publication -->

# Programming Languages

- *R*: free, open-source, designed for analysis
- *python*: also free and open-source, designed for more general
computation
- *BASH*: command language, glues software together

# Code Cleaning and Encapsulation

*RClean*: Simplify code based on specified results.

Lau 2018 *CRAN*

*Encapsulator*: generate a cleaned capsule.

Pasquier et al. 2017 *IEEE CISE*

- Capsule = all necessary software and data
- Cleaned = organize files, remove non-essential code and re-format


# Tools: Encapsulator

- near stream-of-consciousness coding that follows a train of thought in script development,
- output to console that is not written to disk,
- intermediate objects that are abandoned,
- library and new data calls throughout the script,
- output written to disk but not used in final documents,
- code that is not modularized,
- code that is syntactically correct but not particularly comprehensible.

# Tools: Encapsulator

Basic Usage (current paradigm):

1. Code as usual in your normal environment while recording provenance
2. Run encapsulator from the console
3. List desired results
