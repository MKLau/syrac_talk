Recent findings of low levels of reproducibility of research has been
a wake-up call to scientists. In addition to the challenges of making
study details and data and meta-data availible and accessible, the
rapid rise of custom analytical software (such as R, MatLab and Python
analytical scripts) is quickly becoming a significant challenge as
well. Such analytical scripts that are used in scientific research,
even if written in an open-source language, are often written as
informal software written without following best practices, leading to
a proliferation of irreproducbile software. Given the realities of the
demands placed on scientists, we have investigated use of "data
provenance" (i.e. a formalized record of a computational process) to
produce tools to help researchers improve the transparency and
reproducibility of analytical software associated with a research
project. This talk will present the concept of data provenance and how
it has been applied to create tools, such as an automatic project
"capsule" creation program (encapsulator) and a code cleaning package
for R (Rclean), to aid in the process of sharing research for future
uses (i.e. benefaction) through public project repositories like
Dataverse.
